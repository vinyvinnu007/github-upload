Introduction

- Electronics lab:- When doing electronic  projects the main problem occurs at the calculation of power ,resistance and some other significant parameters. So, this application  help in the following factors and make it easier.

1.calculating the resistance of the circuit a)series and b)parallel

2.calculating the passing current and voltage through out the circuit.

\3. calculating the power consumption of the circuit.

` `RESEARCH

- As an electrical and electronics engineer every core project highly depends on electronic components and design of electronic circuit. When we are doing this type of projects we require to calculate the various parameters like power consumption, resistance of the circuit. overall current and voltage passed through the circuit. By knowing this parameters design of  circuit becomes easier and we can restrict the mistakes before building the circuit by checking parameters. Although, we have many applications for calculating this parameters but the main feature of this application i.e., electronics lab is it is actually act like a lab where we can able to know every parameter by integrating it into a  single program.
- By considering the user inputs we can able to know the lifetime of the given project. By color code of resistors this application will calculate the resistance.  

BENIFITS

This application has following Benefits

Gives the Accurate results by considering given inputs for basic electronics circuits

- When we are configuring with more than 10 resistors and capacitors there will be high chances of occurring errors in calculation. So by using this application we can regulate the errors. 

`    `Helpful for beginners

- For beginners it is a tough task to calculate the parameters in a circuit. By using this application it is much more helpful for beginners and get solution in no time.

Cost and Functions

\*In view of evolution of  electronics, the cost of every component and the device for calculating the parameters also high rates approximately 1200rs. i.e.,  Multi meter. But using this application it is most sufficient to calculate the various parameters and gives the accurate results for given inputs   

|Feature | Description

\|--------| -----------------------------------------

|`F1`    | Gives the resistor values based on the color codes

|`F2`    | GIves the reactance values for capacitor and inductor based on the inputs

|`F3`    | Gives battery information based on curent input, voltage and circuit type and usage

|`F4`    | Gives analysis and output for the following types of circuits: 1) Series 2) parallel 3) RLC (resistive, capacitive and inductive all together)

|`F5`    | Gives the power consumption data of a device and also based on the input predicts how long will the device last

This system is very cost effective when compared to various other apps because this system integrates all the factors that are present in multiple apps into one and also can interlink and use all these functions after the other.

EXEMPLIFY OUR SYSTEM

The Electronics lab can able to perform  the following actions: 1)calculate the resistance based on color code. 2)Consumption of battery based on battery type. 3)calculating the lifetime of project based on user inputs. 4)Current , power and voltage across the circuit.

SWOT ANALYSIS

What

Many students will deal with the issue of calculating the parameters when the circuit is configured with 12 or more components. Power calculations will play a major role in projecting the life time of project.

Who

1.For Every person who are going to calculate the complex calculations.

\2. All the students starting from beginning to utmost level when dealing with high configured electronics circuits.

Where

Electronic labs, electrical institutes, electrical projects and more.

When

There is no question like when because until and unless we have hardware technology we have necessity of this application.

How

Handling  this application is very easier because it is just like u give some input it considers some parameters and gives output i.e., input output application. For example if a person wants power consumption of circuit he/she needs to gives some inputs then he will get calculated power in the circuit.
